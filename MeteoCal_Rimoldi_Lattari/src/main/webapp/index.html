<p><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive;">Meteocal is a new weather based online calendar for helping people&nbsp;scheduling their&nbsp;personal events avoiding bad weather conditions in case of outdoor&nbsp;activities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive;">Users,&nbsp;once&nbsp;registered, should be able to create, delete and update events. An&nbsp;event&nbsp;contains information&nbsp;about when and where the event will take place, whether the event will be indoor or outdoor. During&nbsp;event creation, any number of registered users can be invited by&nbsp;the organizer, which is the only one&nbsp;able to update&nbsp;or delete the event. Invited users can only accept or decline the invitation.</span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive;">Once created, the system will&nbsp;enrich the event with weather forecast information (if&nbsp;available). Moreover, it will&nbsp;notify all event participants one day before the event in case of bad&nbsp;weather conditions for outdoor events. Notifications are received by the users when they log into the&nbsp;system.</span></p>
